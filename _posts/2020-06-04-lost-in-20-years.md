title: Lost in 20 years

---
It feels like yesterday that I had taken off my school uniform and kept them in the closet and even today if you wake me up when I'm in deep sleep and tell me that I'm getting late for school , I might go into autopilot and hastily try to don it , ask my father for pocket money, my mom for lunch and rush to my bus stop. I can still sing out every single song that was played on my school bus, recite every prayer that I used to during the morning assembly , and search for all the familiar faces around me.

Life was simple back then  but why do I feel like that I lost everything and everyone now  - even myself.  Why does it feel that it has been forever that there was this genuine smile on my face and I knew who I was , what I wanted and where I was headed to? I only know half of the answer...

A lot happened of thing happened in my life , things that happen with everyone but in ways that they became hard to endure. Everyone loses friends , feels lost , leaves home and misses it badly but does everyone just become stoic when it comes to people , does everyone fear trying to find oneself , does everyone feel like he isn't home even when he's in the same room the walls of which he scribbled on as a kid?
