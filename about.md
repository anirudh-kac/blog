## About this blog

I had left this blog on the back-burner for a long time.This is not going to be  a technical blog nor am I trying to promote my culture or anything through this blog. This is my personal blog, a place where I want to put all the words that have been crawling beneath my skin since long - The stories that I always wanted to share with a friend or those that I wanted the world to know - The letters that I wanted to write some people, the replies I never got to send back. I guess this blog will give you an image of who Anirudh really is - beneath that smile or frown -what he wants to say  when he's silent , or what he doesn't when he's speaking.

Thank You
